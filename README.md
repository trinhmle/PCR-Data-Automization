# PCR-Data-Automization

From PCR machines, you can download a file to look at CT numbers. From the CT number, you can call a sample positive, negative or review. In order to mitigate human error as well as automatize the process so that lab techs can spend more time on different tasks, the executed python code takes the data file and place it into a summarized file for lab techs to read.


Future Goals:
1. Add dashboard.
2. More documentation.
  -(Note: Add steps and code snippets)
